EPROM Generator for the PROXA Printer Interface
-----------------------------------------------

On Windows, use the provided EPROM.EXE to create the binary file
for the EPROM. You may edit EPROM.CFG to suit your needs,
especially to make the actual printout match your character set.
Hopefully, EPROM.CFG is as self-explaining as it should be.

On Linux, just run 'make' to build your binary locally.
