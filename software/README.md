EPROM Generator for the PROXA Printer Interface
-----------------------------------------------

Binaries are available for OS X (eprom, 64 bit) and Windows (EPROM.EXE, 32 bit).
On Linux, just run 'make' to build your binary locally.

In case you need to patch the configuration file eprom.cfg, have a look
inside. It should be pretty self-explaining.
